# web-portfolio
**a portfolio dedicated to my photography and videography brand {WobbleMedia}.**

I created WobbleMedia through multiple different iterations of my online alias name "Gobblywobbler", a fun take that often gets giggles or smiles when I introduce myself with it. I wanted to keep the same feeling but make the brand a little bit more professional seeing as I am doing photography and videography.

One challenge I faced when coming up with my initial draft of the figma website was how I can showcase my work across the portfolio site in a seamless and intuitive way. I did not end up liking much of this process as it was my first time dealing with front end work and I was hesitant to get creative with the layout. I made things particularly hard by changing the outlines from breakpoint to breakpoint and hiding my actual work in smaller sections around the site.

When beginning coding with bootstrap I soon realized that I had so much potential to work with and I wanted to instead put my best work at the forefront of the homepage. Minimizing text I also chose to change up the ways my portfolio pages looked to make them more simple and viewable for potential clients.

Going forward I would like to have more interactivity on my site. animations, more videos embedded throughout, and potentially some animation gifs that creatively reflect myself and my work.

I have learned propely how to use bootstrap to efficiently speed through building site layouts and sections that might take longer than if I were to use base html. Despite it's limits there are many workarounds to its faults which make it have a purpose beyond just its basic uses.
